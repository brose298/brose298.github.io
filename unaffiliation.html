									<h3>Staggering Rise of Unaffiliated</h3>

										<p>Religiously unaffiliated individuals experienced a boom around the same time as the rise of the Internet and paralleled the growth of the Internet after that. Through observation and analysis, it has been determined that the rise of the Internet within America is responsible for about a twenty-percent decrease in religious affiliation among observed religious participants (Downey 2014:1). This conclusion correlates with the growth of religiously unaffiliated throughout the world, with a majority of those unaffiliated located in countries with widespread access to the Internet (Staufenberg, Kemp). With McClure able to dismiss other possible causes and observe the same phenomenon in other parts of the world, the data paints a picture of Internet access influencing the observed religious unaffiliating worldwide. </p>

								<p>Following the analysis of the data, as the world becomes more connected in future years, it should be expected that a similar trend of religious unaffiliating will become more prevalent globally. The rise of technology and the Internet provides a medium to which the phenomenon of religious tinkering emerged. While religious communities are still present worldwide, the worldâ€™s religious populations tied to a particular denomination are on a downward trend in countries where the Internet is prevalent. The tinkering of beliefs and the creation of their views leads more and more people to remove themselves from official affiliation, participation, or whole-hearted commitment to a single religious ideology. It will be interesting to see what this reoccurring trend does to the power and influence of major religious organizations as membership declines.</p>
