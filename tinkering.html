								<h3>Generation Differences&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
								<p>For such a powerful, age-old institution, membership and affiliation across the board have steadily declined in the past few decades. While older generations, such as the baby boomers, grew up with a hard-coded, typically undoubtful outlook on Religion, more recent generations have been more likely to ‘tinker’ with their beliefs rather than accept what is handed to them (Wuthnow 2007). This rift between generational thinking may be attributed to the increasing number of individuals who identify as atheists or agnostic. However, the cause of such a difference in attitude can be credited to the widespread adoption of technology and the development of the Internet.  &nbsp;</p>

								<p>To contextualize how this attitude of religious tinkering may have developed, it is best to look at the advance in a powerful technology that has become prevalent over the past few years on a global scale: computers. In the modern world, computers make up a large portion of daily life and are present in everything from phones to cars and even coffee machines. In 1981 the Internet was born, and as time advanced, computers and the Internet became intertwined. The Internet was able to pave the way for communication on a global scale with speed and reach never seen before. With the expansive reach of the Internet, new ideas and beliefs flowed worldwide. </p>

								<h4>Rise of Tinkering</h4>
								<p>Tinkering is best referred to as the application of accumulated insights and creativity from technological use onto ideas and everyday life. This new ability to commune worldwide provided a medium for the average person to intermingle with others they otherwise would never have. This highway of information paved the road for religious tinkering, allowing people to incorporate new beliefs and outlooks on theology.</p>

								<p>The creativity which technology use promotes alongside the wealth of knowledge provided by the freedom of access to information on the Internet seems to promote this spur of unaffiliating and tinkering. While Internet use does not necessarily discourage religious belief or participation, it creates a space where users can explore other beliefs and design their own to better coincide with their lives. </p>
